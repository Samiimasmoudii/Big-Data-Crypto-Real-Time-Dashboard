Plan to Modify Your Kafka Producer
Fetch Cryptocurrency Data:

Replace the generateSensorData method with a method that queries the Polygon.io API using HTTP.
Parse the JSON response to extract relevant fields.
Adjust Kafka Producer Logic:

Use the fetched cryptocurrency data to produce messages.
Serialize and send the data in a format suitable for your Spark job (e.g., JSON).
Adapt Spark and Cassandra:

Update the Spark job to handle cryptocurrency data (if needed).
Ensure Cassandra's schema aligns with the new data structure.
